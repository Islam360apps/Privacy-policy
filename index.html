  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: October 2025</p>

  <div class="card">
    <p><strong>VoxaTalk: AI Voice Studio</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app accesses, how we use it, and what choices you have. By using the app, you agree to the practices described here.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone Access</strong> — Used only when you record or generate audio within the app. Audio is processed for the requested feature and is <em>not</em> recorded in the background.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage / Media Access</strong> — Used to save, export, and load audio files you create. We do not scan or collect unrelated files.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Personal Data</strong> — Device model, OS version, app version, coarse performance and crash data (anonymous/aggregated) to improve stability and quality.</li>
    <li><strong>No Personal Data by Default</strong> — We do not collect your name, email, phone, address, or other directly identifiable data inside the app. If you contact us by email, we’ll receive whatever information you include in that email.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide core functionality (voice recording, AI voice features, file saving/export).</li>
    <li>To improve audio quality, app performance, usability, and to fix bugs.</li>
    <li>To comply with applicable laws, prevent abuse, and protect our users and services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. AI &amp; Cloud Processing</h2>
  <p>Some AI voice features may temporarily process audio on-device or via secure cloud services solely to generate the requested output.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Audio sent for AI processing is used only to complete your request and is not sold.</li>
    <li>Unless explicitly stated for a specific feature, audio is not stored permanently on our servers.</li>
    <li>We follow data-minimization principles and retain only what is necessary to deliver the feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>VoxaTalk may include third-party SDKs or services. These providers have their own privacy policies and may independently process limited data (e.g., device identifiers) to deliver their services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (advertising)</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (performance/crash analytics)</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> (core Android functionality)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Where supported, you can reset your advertising ID in your device settings. Ad personalization controls are provided by Google.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Content you save locally (audio files) remains on your device until you delete it.</li>
    <li>Anonymous analytics and crash data may be retained for a commercially reasonable period to improve the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required by your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can disable <em>Microphone</em> and <em>Storage</em> permissions in Android Settings → Apps → VoxaTalk → Permissions (note: some features will stop working).</li>
    <li>You can clear app data or uninstall the app at any time.</li>
    <li>You can opt out of personalized ads from Google via device settings where available.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the date at the top of this page.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or requests about this Privacy Policy, contact us at: <a href="mailto:Islamappsstudio@mail.com">Islamappsstudio@mail.com</a></p>
